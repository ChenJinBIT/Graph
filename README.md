# Graph
Some materials about graph.

* CVPR 2020 [DEPARA: Deep Attribution Graph for Deep Knowledge Transferability(http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Song_DEPARA_Deep_Attribution_Graph_for_Deep_Knowledge_Transferability_CVPR_2020_paper.html)
 * code  https://github.com/zju-vipa/DEPARA
 * main idea: construct attribute graph to explore the relationship between different tasks, and then enable knowledge transfer. The proposed method can be used for pre-trained model selection and layer selection.
